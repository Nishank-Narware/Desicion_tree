# Desicion_tree
A Decision Tree is a flowchart-like structure used for classification and regression. It splits data based on feature values at each node, creating branches for different outcomes. Leaves represent final decisions. It's intuitive and handles both numerical &amp; categorical data, making decisions by asking a series of questions.
